## Vim Configuration
In the root directory you will have a hidden ".vimrc" Vim configuration file.

As it says, you will need to create your own ".myvimrc" file and add the configuration lines inside.

Just add the following lines inside:

```conf
# Enable the mouse input
set mouse=a

# Show lines numbers
set number

# Apply colors syntax
syntax on
```
